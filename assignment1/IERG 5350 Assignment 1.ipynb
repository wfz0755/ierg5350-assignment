However, we suggest you to go through the documents step by step, which will give you a better sense of the content.\n",

    "Every Gym environment should contain the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `env.step(action)` To step the environment by applying `action`. Will return four things: `observation, reward, done, info`, wherein `done` is a boolean value indicating whether this **episode** is finished. `info` may contain some information the user is interested in, we do not use it.\n",
    "2. `env.reset()` To reset the environment, back to the initial state. Will return the initial observation.\n",
    "3. `env.render()` To render the current state of the environment for human-being\n",
    "4. `env.action_space` The allowed action format. In our case, it is `Discrete(4)` which means the action is an integer in the range [0, 1, 2, 3]. Therefore the `action` for `step(action)` should obey the limit of the action space.\n",
    "5. `env.observation_space` The observation space.\n",
    "6. `env.seed(seed)` To set the random seed of the environment. So the result is replicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the word **episode** means the process that an agent interacts with the environment from the initial state to the terminal state. Within one episode, the agent will only receive one `done=True`, when it goes to the terminal state (the agent is dead or the game is over).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use \"FrozenLake8x8-v0\" as our environment. In this environment, the agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile. The meaning of each character:\n",
